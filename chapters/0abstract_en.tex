  Robot Framework is a keyword-driven open-source automation framework that can be used for test automation and \gls{rpa}. It is extendable with multiple libraries that can be implemented with different programming languages and the syntax is utilized by human-readable keywords. \newline

  This thesis is based on the implementation of Robot Framework automation for \gls{lora} devices that utilize \gls{otaa} for communication with the server, and it was carried out for Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The data was collected by exploring online material about different Robot Framework libraries and details about the Chirpstack network server and LORIX One gateway together with the \gls{lora} end device that was created by a former student in their final year project. The implementation was tested during the process by running the Robot Framework script and  testing that the connections with the device, server, and the gateway work properly.\newline

  The result provides a Robot Framework script that adds \gls{lora} end devices to a newly created application in the ChirpStack network server where the devices have a connection by using \gls{otaa} through the LORIX One gateway that uses \gls{lorawan}. \newline

  The outcome of this project helps Metropolia University of Applied Sciences by removing some repetitive tasks the lecturers have needed to do on the onsets of wireless technology courses and providing more time that can be allocated to instructional activities. \newline
