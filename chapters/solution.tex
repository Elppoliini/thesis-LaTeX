\chapter{Implementation} \label{ch:impl}
This chapter provides a detailed explanation of how the project was implemented from the environment set-ups to the automation and execution of that automation, outlining the practises, techniques, and steps taken to bring the project to completion.
Metropolia University of Applied Sciences provided a LORIX One gateway, micro\gls{sd} card with ChirpStack Gateway OS image installed to it, a spare micro\gls{sd} card and a \gls{lora} end device that is used in the courses the project is done for.

\section{Setting up LORIX One}
The LORIX One gateway is is used to establish the connection between the Chirpstack and the \gls{lora} devices and the gateway came together with an micro\gls{sd} card where the ChirpStack Gateway OS image was installed already.
The LORIX One has a slot for the micro\gls{sd} card inside where it was put.
After that the LORIX One was connected to a router to get ethernet access and to an outlet to get power.
