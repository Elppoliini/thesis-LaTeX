\chapter{Implementation} \label{ch:impl}
This chapter provides a detailed explanation of how the project was implemented from the environment set-ups to the automation and execution of that automation, outlining the practises, techniques, and steps taken to bring the project to completion.
Metropolia University of Applied Sciences provided a LORIX One gateway, micro\gls{sd} card with ChirpStack Gateway \gls{os} image installed to it, a spare micro\gls{sd} card and a \gls{lora} end device that is used in the courses the project is done for.

\section{Setting up LORIX One}
The LORIX One gateway is used to establish the connection between the Chirpstack and the \gls{lora} devices and the gateway came together with an micro\gls{sd} card where the ChirpStack Gateway \gls{os} image was installed already.
The LORIX One has a slot for the micro\gls{sd} card inside where it was put.
After that the LORIX One was connected to a router to get ethernet access and to an outlet to get power.
When the gateway is powered it starts the boot immediately meaning in this case the ChirpStack Gateway \gls{os} image.

\section{Setting up Chirpstack}
When the connection is stable in the LORIX One gateway and its status led blinks on a heartbeat mode the \gls{os} installation can be started.
The \gls{os} is booted each time it is connected to a power supply and the user needs to login using \gls{ssh}.
The login can be done using ssh command as seen in figure on a command prompt.

CODE FIGURE ssh user@lorixip

When the user has logged in successfully a message seen in figure is shown.

FIGURE OF CHIRPSTACK.IO MESSAGE

As mentioned earlier the micro\gls{sd} card was provided with the Chirpstack \gls{os} and also with the needed credentials to log in.
The data the card contained the latest settings that Metropolia University of Applied Sciences uses and no new configurations were needed.
The command prompt was closed with exit command.




\section{Creating Excel sheet for the end devices}
\section{Creating automation}
\subsection{variables.py}
Variables.py is a python file where all the variables in are stored to easily modify them if needed from one place.
In this project the file is imported to the test suites which uses those variables for setting up the test suite for log in.

\subsection{Suite Setup and Suite Teardown}
In this project Suite setup was selected to bu utilized to improve unnecessary repeat of steps to be taken.
The suite setup was utilized to a suite initalization file called \_\_init\_\_.robot file which is run once and before any
