\chapter{Conclusions} \label{ch:conc}

The thesis topic was a success overall.
It provided the user an automation script that handles a variation of tasks that can be done with ChirpStack.
All the agreed features were included in the script.
The work provides the educators of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences a tool to increase their productivity by reducing the amount of time that the manual completion of the tasks would normally take.

Following suggested steps would be to update the automation to be done using the \gls{grpc} API that ChirpStack provides.
This would most likely increase the speed of the running time.
However, further research should be done beforehand.
The reliability should also increase when the implementation is not relying so much to the web interface and the possible future changes.
Using \gls{grpc} would most likely increase the maintainability as well.
