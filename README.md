## Compiler

Use XeLaTeX as a compiler.

### Compilation

Usual compilation sequence (minted package require external Python Pygments script to be installed ([check the docs](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted?lang=en)))

    # minted require -shell-escape to run  external script. 
    # -8bit avoid ^^I for tabs in minted.
    $ xelatex -shell-escape -8bit main
    # If any change in the bibliography
    $ bibtex8 main
    # If any change with the abbreviation or acronym
    $ makeglossaries main
    #Then compile again
    $ xelatex -shell-escape -8bit main
    #And if still some citation or label warnings, compile once more
    $ xelatex -shell-escape -8bit main
